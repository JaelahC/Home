		   <P> There are many different pound cake types available today in many different nations and areas,
		   each with their own unique style. The air that was beaten into the batter was the only leavener that
		   was first employed in the cake. Baking soda and baking powder were introduced as artificial leaveners
		   to lessen the density of the cake only in the early 1900s. The addition of flavouring ingredients like
		   vanilla or almond extract or dried fruits like cranberries or currants are examples of additional variants.
		   To get a moist cake, cooking or vegetable oil has occasionally been used in place of all or part of the butter.
		   The American sour cream pound cake is one of the more well-known varieties. Sour cream is used instead of butter.
		   To moisten the cake and give it a hint of tang, sour cream is used in place of butter. Despite these differences, 
		   which significantly change the qualities and flavour of the cake, the term "pound cake" is frequently used. The French 
		   word for pound cake is "quarte-quarts," which translates to "four quarters," with a quarter standing for one pound. Rum 
		   and mashed bananas are added to the cake for Christmas Eve in the French-speaking Caribbean region. The Spanish phonetic 
		   approximation of the word for the pound cake in Venezuela and Colombia is ponque. In essence, it is a cake covered in cream 
		   and sugar and soaked in wine. The traditional recipe is used to make the panque dish in Mexico.

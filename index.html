            <h1> Cakes </h1>

            <h2> Introduction </h2> 

            <p> A sweet treat called cake is usually baked. Cakes were originally just loaves with frosting on top,
			but they have evolved into a wide variety of sweets that can be simple or fancy and share common with pastries, 
			custards, fruit tarts, and pies. Flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, a liquid, and flavourings like baking soda 
			and/or baking powder are common cake ingredients. With several options for the main ingredients, other ingredients
			and flavours that are often used include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, almonds, chocolate, and extracts like vanilla.
			Cakes may also be iced with buttercream or another frosting, filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (such as pastry cream),
			and decorated with fondant, piped edges or candied fruit. </p>

            <h2> Who invented cakes </h2>
             
			<p> Round, flat, unleavened breads fried on a hot stone were the origins of cake in ancient Egypt. 
			Through the addition of new ingredients and the development of fresh baking ways, baked goods continued 
			to change across many centuries. These flat breads were made baked thanks to the Egyptians' discovery and
			skill of using natural yeast. </p>
			 
            <h2> Types of cakes </h2>
			 
			<h3> Pound Cake </h3>

		    <p> Pound cake is a type of cake traditionally made with a pound of each four ingredients such as: </p>
		<ol>

            <li> Flour </li>

            <li> Butter </li>

            <li> Eggs </li>

            <li> Sugar </li>
			
            <p> The origins of pound cake lie in Northern Europe and date back to the early 18th century. Initially,
		   the pound cake weighed four pounds; that rules out the possibility of it being named after its weight. 
		   The ingredients in the cake, however, were measured up to one pound.</p>
